# Interest Images Instructions

Your website is currently using online placeholder images for the interests section. To replace these with actual images that represent your interests, follow these steps:

## Current Placeholder Images:
- Skiing: https://placehold.co/600x400/3a86ff/FFFFFF?text=Skiing
- Fly Fishing: https://placehold.co/600x400/38b000/FFFFFF?text=Fly+Fishing
- Hiking: https://placehold.co/600x400/9d4edd/FFFFFF?text=Hiking
- Travel: https://placehold.co/600x400/ff7b00/FFFFFF?text=Travel

## To replace with your own images:

1. Add your images to this directory (`src/images/interests/`) with the following names:
   - skiing.jpg
   - fly-fishing.jpg
   - hiking.jpg
   - travel.jpg

2. Then, update the Interests.js component in `src/components/Interests.js` to use your local images:
   ```js
   <img src="images/interests/skiing.jpg" alt="Skiing in Montana" class="interest-image">
   <img src="images/interests/fly-fishing.jpg" alt="Fly fishing in a mountain stream" class="interest-image">
   <img src="images/interests/hiking.jpg" alt="Hiking in the mountains" class="interest-image">
   <img src="images/interests/travel.jpg" alt="International travel destinations" class="interest-image">
   ```

## Image Recommendations:

- Use high-quality images with good resolution (at least 800x600 pixels)
- Choose landscape orientation for better fitting in the cards
- Pick images that represent your personal experiences if possible
- Images with good lighting and vibrant colors will enhance the visual appeal

## Where to Find Images:

1. Your personal photo collection (best option for authenticity)
2. Free stock photo sites if needed:
   - Unsplash (https://unsplash.com)
   - Pexels (https://pexels.com)
   - Pixabay (https://pixabay.com)

## After Adding Images:

Once you've added these images to the `/src/images/interests/` directory, your website will display them automatically in the interests section, making it more visually appealing and personal.
