# Audio Demo File Templates

For the PipeCat AI demonstration, you'll need to prepare several audio files:

## 1. welcome-message.wav
This should be a recording that includes:
- An introduction in English
- A showcase of the same voice speaking French
- Return to English to conclude

Script is available in src/js/welcome-script.js

## 2. english-demo.wav
A recording of the English text: "I love working with JavaScript, React, Python, and Flask. They're my go-to tools for building powerful web applications."

## 3. french-demo.wav
A recording of the French text: "J'adore travailler avec JavaScript, React, Python et Flask. Ce sont mes outils préférés pour créer des applications web puissantes."

## 4. cloned-demo.wav
This will be dynamically generated in a real implementation. For now, a placeholder file would be another version of the English demo with slightly different voice characteristics.

## Implementation Steps

1. Record these files using your voice or a voice actor
2. Alternatively, use an existing text-to-speech service to generate these files as placeholders
3. For a production implementation, integrate with the actual PipeCat AI API
4. Place all WAV files directly in this directory
