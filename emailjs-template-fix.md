# EmailJS Template Configuration Fix

## Problem
You're sending emails with EmailJS, but while senders get a confirmation email, you (as the recipient) are not receiving any emails.

## Diagnosis
This is a common issue with EmailJS templates. The template is likely configured with a static email address in the "To Email" field instead of using the dynamic `{{to_email}}` parameter that you're sending from your code.

## How to Fix

1. **Log in to your EmailJS dashboard**: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin

2. **Go to Email Templates**: Click on "Email Templates" in the left navigation

3. **Find your template**: Look for template ID `template_pplvcfl` and click on it to edit

4. **Check the "To Email" field**: This is the crucial step! 
   - If it contains a static email address (like "example@example.com"), change it to:
   ```
   {{to_email}}
   ```
   - If it contains another parameter name, change it to match what you're sending from your code

5. **Other Important Parameters to Check**:
   - "From Name" should be set to `{{from_name}}`
   - "Reply-To" should be set to `{{reply_to}}`
   - "Subject" can include dynamic variables like `{{subject}}`

6. **Save the template**: Click the "Save" button at the bottom of the page

7. **Test the configuration**: Use the email-debug.html file to test if you're now receiving emails

## Additional Notes

- The code is correctly sending the `to_email` parameter with your email address `csorini13@gmail.com`
- We've added an alternative parameter name `recipient` as some EmailJS templates might use different parameter names
- If the fix above doesn't work, check what parameter name your specific template is expecting for the recipient email
